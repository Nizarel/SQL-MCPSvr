# Security Guidelines for Azure OpenAI LLM Model Factory

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Credential Management

#### ‚úÖ DO
- **Use JSON configuration files for local development** (with proper .gitignore)
- **Use environment variables for production deployments**
- **Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets management**
- **Rotate API keys regularly** (quarterly recommended)
- **Use managed identities** when deploying to Azure services

#### ‚ùå DON'T
- **Never hardcode credentials** in source code
- **Never commit sensitive files** to version control
- **Never use development credentials** in production
- **Never share API keys** via email, chat, or documentation

### 2. Configuration File Security

#### Local Development Files to Protect:
```
appsettings.Development.json   # ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains sensitive data
appsettings.Local.json         # ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains sensitive data
*.secrets.json                 # ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains sensitive data
.env files                     # ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains sensitive data
```

#### Required .gitignore Entries:
```gitignore
# Sensitive configuration files
appsettings.Development.json
appsettings.Local.json
*.secrets.json
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
```

### 3. Azure OpenAI Security Features

#### Enable These Security Features:
- **Content filtering** for inappropriate content detection
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Network restrictions** via virtual networks
- **Logging and monitoring** for audit trails
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for fine-grained permissions

#### Monitor for Security Events:
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Large volume requests
- Requests from unexpected geographic locations

### 4. Production Deployment Security

#### Recommended Production Setup:
```csharp
// Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets
var keyVaultUrl = "https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/";
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var secretClient = new SecretClient(new Uri(keyVaultUrl), credential);

// Retrieve secrets securely
var apiKey = await secretClient.GetSecretAsync("azure-openai-api-key");
var endpoint = await secretClient.GetSecretAsync("azure-openai-endpoint");
```

#### Environment-Specific Configuration:
- **Development**: appsettings.Development.json (local only)
- **Staging**: Environment variables + Azure Key Vault
- **Production**: Azure Key Vault + Managed Identity

### 5. Network Security

#### Recommended Network Configuration:
- **Private endpoints** for Azure OpenAI
- **Virtual network integration** for compute resources
- **Firewall rules** to restrict access by IP
- **TLS 1.2+** for all communications

### 6. Compliance Considerations

#### Data Handling:
- **Review data residency requirements** for your region
- **Implement data retention policies** as required
- **Document data flows** for compliance audits
- **Consider GDPR, HIPAA, SOC** requirements as applicable

#### Audit Trail:
- **Enable diagnostic logging** for Azure OpenAI
- **Monitor API usage** and response patterns
- **Implement request/response logging** (without sensitive data)
- **Regular security reviews** of access patterns

### 7. Incident Response

#### If Credentials Are Compromised:
1. **Immediately revoke** the compromised API key
2. **Generate new credentials** for affected services
3. **Review access logs** for unauthorized usage
4. **Update all applications** with new credentials
5. **Document the incident** for future prevention

#### Emergency Contacts:
- **Azure Support**: For service-related security issues
- **Internal Security Team**: For organization security policies
- **Compliance Officer**: For regulatory compliance issues

### 8. Code Security Practices

#### Secure Coding Guidelines:
```csharp
// ‚úÖ Good - Using configuration validation
try 
{
    var config = new Config();
    config.ValidateConfiguration();
    var client = ExtensionsClientFactory.CreateChatClient();
}
catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
{
    // Handle missing configuration securely
    logger.LogError("Configuration validation failed: {Message}", ex.Message);
    throw;
}

// ‚ùå Bad - Hardcoded credentials
var client = new AzureOpenAIClient(
    new Uri("https://hardcoded-endpoint.com"), 
    new AzureKeyCredential("hardcoded-key"));
```

#### Input Validation:
- **Validate all user inputs** before sending to Azure OpenAI
- **Implement rate limiting** for user requests
- **Sanitize responses** before displaying to users
- **Log security-relevant events** (authentication, authorization)

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] Credentials are stored securely (Key Vault/Environment variables)
- [ ] Development configuration files are in .gitignore
- [ ] API keys are rotated regularly
- [ ] Network access is restricted appropriately
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are enabled
- [ ] Compliance requirements are met
- [ ] Incident response procedures are documented
- [ ] Security reviews are scheduled regularly

## üìû Getting Help

For security-related questions or incidents:
- **Azure Security Center**: Monitor security recommendations
- **Azure Support**: For service-specific security guidance
- **Microsoft Security Response Center**: For reporting security vulnerabilities

**Remember**: Security is a shared responsibility. While Microsoft secures the Azure OpenAI service, you are responsible for securing your application's configuration, credentials, and data handling practices.
